# Elk Contributions

When 2022's [Twitter Migration](https://ayos.blog/obscure-services-i-use/) happened, I started actively using Mastodon and met the people who started [Elk](https://github.com/elk-zone).

From its early closed-alpha days, I have enjoyed contributing to the project:
1. Preview Cards
1. Content Filters API
1. Media visibility configurations
1. Notifications dynamic filters

# Elk talk proposal - FOSDEM 2025

## Application
- Type: 25 minutes
- Session: Social Web
- Topic: Clients for ActivityPub (Mastodon)
- Working Title: Elk: A new chapter


## Abstract

Elk is a nimble client for Mastodon with great attention to user experience, and boasting unique features such as being an installable Progressive Web App (PWA), support for code blocks with syntax highlighting, and markdown formatting.

Started by core maintainers behind popular web tooling in the Vue/Vite/Nuxt ecosystem in 2022, it attracted hundreds of contributors and resulted to the creation of new libraries now widely used in other projects.

~~After two years of building with Mastodon as its focus, the Elk project now faces a new chapter as a new AT Protocol captures the attention of the web frontend community.~~

In this talk, I will give a brief history of Elk from a non-vue developer contributorâ€™s perspective, what are the key strengths of the technology under the hood, and a look forward to the future of the project.

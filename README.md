## Hi, I'm Ayo 👋

I am a newbie engineering manager at a large bank headquartered in Amsterdam. I'm also a certified software architecture professional (CPSA‑F®) by [isaqb.org](https://isaqb.org).

I work on several hobby projects such as [cozy.pub](https://cozy.pub), [mcfly.js.org](https://mcfly.js.org), and [webcomponent.io](https://webcomponent.io), as well as other [small libraries](https://www.npmjs.com/~aayco).

I also try to help out in various ways on projects like [elk.zone](https://elk.zone), [webtoo.ls](https://m.webtoo.ls/public/local), and [vitest](https://elk.zone/m.webtoo.ls/@vitest).
